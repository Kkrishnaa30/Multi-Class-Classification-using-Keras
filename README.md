# 🚀 Multi-Class Classification using Keras  

Welcome to the **Multi-Class Classification using Keras** repository! 🎯 This project is focused on building deep learning models to predict customer segments using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**.  

## 📌 Project Overview  

In this project, we aim to classify customers into **four different segments (A, B, C, D)** based on given features. The goal is to develop a robust deep learning model that can accurately predict the segment of new potential customers.  

🔹 **Dataset**: Provided in `train.csv` and `test.csv`  
🔹 **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
🔹 **Models Used**:  
   - ✅ Standard deep learning model with best practices  
   - ✅ Hyperparameter-tuned model using **Keras Tuner**  


## 🚦 Workflow  

1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical values.  
2️⃣ **Model 1**: Implementing a deep learning model using best practices.  
3️⃣ **Model 2**: Using **Keras Tuner** to optimize hyperparameters.  
4️⃣ **Evaluation**: Checking accuracy, classification reports, and visualizing training vs. validation loss.  
5️⃣ **Predictions**: Generating predictions on `test.csv`.  

## 📊 Results & Insights  

✅ **Comparison of Models**: Performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
✅ **Business Impact**: The model helps the automobile company effectively segment and target new customers.  

## 🛠 Future Improvements  

🚀 Try advanced architectures such as CNNs or Transformer-based models for better accuracy.  
📈 Experiment with more extensive hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.  
🔍 Use additional external data sources to improve segmentation quality.
